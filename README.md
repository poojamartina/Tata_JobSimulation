# Tata_JobSimulation
I have completed Tata's Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights on Forage. In the simulation, I:
Completed a simulation involving creating data visualizations for Tata Consultancy Services
Prepared questions for a meeting with client senior leadership
Created visuals for data analysis to help executives with effective decision making

It was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a consulting team at Tata.
I worked on a project to help a retail client review their revenue data to prepare for the future. I created data visuals, practiced using Tableau and PowerBI to represent information, and built my presentation skills in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on strategic problems for clients and I'm excited to apply these skills on a consulting team at a company like Tata.
